            <h2>IT Service Delivery Life Cycle: Strategy, Design, and Assessment</h2>
            <p> For my IT 6413 Team Project, I worked on completing the full life cycle of IT service delivery within a medium-sized, fictitious organization as the project leader.
                The goal of the project was to develop an IT service strategy, design IT services to meet the business needs, and assess the effectiveness of the current IT services.
                The project was divided into four phases, each with its own objectives.
                In the first phase, we are focused on setting up the business scenario for our fictitious organization.
                This includes defining the type of business it represents, whether it’s a company I’m familiar with or a new business concept we create together.
                Once the business scenario is established, we’ll move on to creating a service strategy in the second phase, which involves developing an IT strategy that aligns with the organization’s goals.
                For the third phase, we will design the IT services, including creating a service level agreement (SLA) that ensures the services meet the needs of the business.
                Finally, in the fourth phase, we will assess how effectively our services are performing and whether they align with the organization’s objectives.</p>
